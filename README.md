> **MacOS: 'app is damaged and can't be opened'**  
> If you're on macOS, please note that macOS may say the app is damaged and can't be opened. If that is the case, you will need to use the `xattr -cr <file>` command to tell macOS the app is safe. A tutorial for this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjCMBisZ4Is).
